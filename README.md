Here are two penetration tests I've preformed during my bootcamp coursework for Flatiron School (cybersecurity enginerring).

The first document shows a pen test for Uber.
Uber was nice enough to let our cohort OSINT/examine their companies cybersecurity positioning.

The second .pdf is for a pen test preformed on the 'Metasploitable3' machine.
We had 4 hours to exploit and CTFs
Metaspoitable3 has a few known vulnerabilites and I gained alot of knowledge during this process.
We preformed Caputure the Flag (CTF) to see how many flags we could obtain. 
In 4 hours I gained a shell and out of the 13 flags (playing cards) I captured 5.
