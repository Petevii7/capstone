# capstone
I conducted two penetration tests as part of my cybersecurity engineering bootcamp coursework at Flatiron School. 
The first assessment involved analyzing Uber's cybersecurity posture, where we were granted the opportunity to perform open-source intelligence (OSINT) and examine their security measures.

The second test focused on the 'Metasploitable3' machine, a lab environment with known vulnerabilities. 
In this challenge, I had a limited timeframe of 4 hours to exploit the system and engage in Capture the Flag (CTF) activities. 
Throughout this exercise, I enhanced my cybersecurity knowledge and skills. 
I successfully gained access to the system and managed to capture 5 out of the 13 flags (represented as playing cards) within the allotted time
